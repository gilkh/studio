## 1. Client Features (Event Planners)

The client-facing side of the application empowers users to effortlessly plan and organize their events.

*   **AI-Powered Event Planner:** Clients can describe their event (type, date, budget, guest count), and the platform's AI generates a complete, customizable planning timeline with suggested tasks, deadlines, and estimated costs.
*   **Explore Services & Offers:** A comprehensive dashboard allows clients to browse, search, and filter a marketplace of vendor services and fixed-price offers. Advanced filtering is available based on category-specific features (e.g., "Outdoor Space" for venues).
*   **Direct Messaging & Quoting:** Clients can initiate conversations with vendors, request custom quotes for services, and receive detailed, itemized quotes directly within the integrated chat system.
*   **Seamless Booking:** For fixed-price "Offers," clients can book directly through the platform by selecting a date and completing a secure (simulated) payment process. All bookings are consolidated into a personal calendar.
*   **Saved Items & Reviews:** Users can save their favorite services and offers for later and can leave detailed reviews and star ratings for vendors after a booking is complete.
*   **Personalized Dashboard:** The client homepage provides a snapshot of upcoming bookings, saved items, and featured services, offering a personalized entry point to the app.

## 2. Vendor Features (Service Providers)

The vendor portal provides all the tools necessary for businesses to showcase their work, manage leads, and grow their client base.

*   **Public Profile & Portfolio Management:** Vendors have a customizable public profile where they can manage their business name, description, contact details, and a gallery of portfolio images and videos.
*   **Service & Offer Listings:** Vendors can create two types of listings: quote-based "Services" and fixed-price "Offers." They can manage all details, including pricing, media, and availability for offers.
*   **Lead & Quote Management:** A dedicated dashboard shows all incoming quote requests from clients. Vendors can respond with detailed, line-item-based quotes directly through the platform.
*   **Booking Calendar:** All confirmed bookings (from both approved quotes and direct offer bookings) are displayed in a comprehensive calendar view, helping vendors manage their schedule.
*   **Business Analytics Dashboard:** The vendor homepage includes a dashboard with key metrics, such as the number of active listings and pending requests, and a chart visualizing quote and booking trends over time.
*   **Tiered Accounts & Upgrades:** The platform supports different account tiers (e.g., Free, VIP). Vendors can request to upgrade their account to access more features.

## 3. Administrator Features

The admin dashboard is a powerful, centralized hub for overseeing the entire platform, managing users, and monitoring business activity.

*   **Comprehensive User Management:** Admins have a complete list of all users (clients and vendors). They can view and edit user profiles, change vendor account tiers, update verification status (e.g., 'Verified', 'Trusted'), disable accounts, or delete users entirely.
*   **Vendor Onboarding System:** To maintain quality, new vendors must register with a unique code. Admins can generate, view, and manage these single-use registration codes.
*   **Platform Analytics:** The admin dashboard features analytics, including total user and vendor counts, total bookings, and a chart illustrating user growth trends over time.
*   **Inquiry & Upgrade Management:** Admins can review and manage incoming inquiries from potential new vendors and handle upgrade requests submitted by existing vendors.
*   **Centralized Messaging View:** A special "Messages" tab allows admins to view all conversations happening on the platform in a read-only mode for support and moderation purposes.
*   **Danger Zone:** A section for high-risk, platform-wide actions, such as simulating a password reset for all users.
